# All-of-zem!
### The perfect tool to learn a new language.


Want to learn a new programming language? Today is your lucky day! This is All-of-zem (A.K.A AOZ), a place where the same program is written in as many languages as possible. It even comes with it's own API and client! All the code is stored inside the `programs/` directory, and each sub-directory is a program. The code with filenames `main.***` (`***` being the extension) are working code, however files `broken.***` are not working code.

# How to contribute:
## NOTE: the variable names should be identical, and the structure should be as close to others as possible, while still keeping that language's idioms.
### Fix a `broken.***` file

### Add a new language
If you know a language enough to be able to re-write a program, please do by submitting a pull request!
### Create a new program
Are you adventurous? Have the same program written in AT LEAST TWO different languages? Please contribute by submitting a pull request!
### Fix some code that could be done better
If you find some code that could be done more efficiently, please fix it by submitting a pull request!
